# Cellular Automaton Generator

## Overview

This project is a Java-based application that generates and visualizes cellular automata within a `JFrame` window. Cellular automata are mathematical models used to simulate complex systems through simple, discrete units called cells. Each cell evolves based on a set of rules and the states of neighboring cells. This project provides an interactive way to explore various cellular automata rules and patterns.

## Features

- **Rule Selection**: Choose from predefined rules (e.g., Rule 30, Rule 110, Game of Life) or define your own custom rules.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- Gradle: Version 8 or higher

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bobacho/cellular_automata.git

2. Run the project:
```bash
   cd cellular_automata/
   gradle run
```
